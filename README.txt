To run the example notebook, you'll need to have python3 on your computer. You'll also need to install Jupyter, RISE, Strauss, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pandas. You can install these packages by just typing 'pip install requirements.txt' in the terminal and hitting enter.

You'll also need to download the 'ChateauGrand-Plus-Instruments-bs16i-v4' soundfont from here: https://sites.google.com/site/soundfonts4u/ , and put it in the same directory (folder) where you have this code.

Strauss has great example notebooks on Google Colab if you'd like to play with sonifications but don't want to download anything or set up python on your computer: https://colab.research.google.com/github/james-trayford/strauss/blob/colab_examples/ 

The RISE documentation explains how to make the notebook into a slideshow: https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html

To run each notebook cell in the normal mode (i.e. not as a presentation), just hit Shift and Enter (or Return, if on Mac). You could also use the 'Run Cell' option in the drop-down menu at the top of the page.
