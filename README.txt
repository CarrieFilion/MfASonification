To run the example notebook, you'll need to have python3 on your computer. You'll also need to install Jupyter, RISE, Strauss, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pandas. You can install these packages by just typing 'pip install requirements.txt' in the terminal and hitting enter.

You'll also need to download the 'ChateauGrand-Plus-Instruments-bs16i-v4' soundfont from here: https://sites.google.com/site/soundfonts4u/ , and put it in the same directory (folder) where you have this code.
